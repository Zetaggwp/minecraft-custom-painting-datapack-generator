Small Tool To Automatically Generate Custom Painting Datapacks & Resourcepacks For Minecraft

Requires Java 23 To Run

**Planned Features**
- Automatically create all the files necessary to have a datapack using a simple GUI
- Automatically add the images to a resourcepack

**Possible Future Features** (Depends on motivation and other people's use cases)
- Automatically add the paintings to the placeable tag
- Automatically Zip the files

**Not Going To** (Unless a big push for it is made)
- Allow for customizing pack.mcmeta
- Allow for customizing pack.png

Made by Zetaggwp, and the code is probably garbage.
